You MUST use pronouns conventional to web novels, such as “nàng”, “hắn”, “y”, “bổn tọa”, “lão phu”, “người kia”. 4. **Purity:** The output must be **ENTIRELY** in Vietnamese. Do not include any Chinese characters, pinyin, or untranslated text. 5. **Formatting:** Preserve paragraph breaks from the source text. **Source Text to Translate:**\n---\n{SOURCE_TEXT}\n---\n**Vietnamese Translation:`;
